sixs (acronym for SImple eXtensible Sites) is a micro web framework written in PHP.

* abandoned since 2004 but some sites made with sixs still working.

* designed for small sites and does not use any DBMS because site contents stored in plain text files but it’s possible to use some modules for interacting with DBMS.

* is cross-platform: tested with PHP 4 and 5, FreeBSD 4–7 and Windows 2000.

* you can edit content of your site via web interface or by files editing.

* you can make heterogenous sites with sixs: some pages may be a static HTML pages, some pages may be produced via CGI scripts etc.
